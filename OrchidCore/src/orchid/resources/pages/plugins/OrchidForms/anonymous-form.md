This page demonstrates an example of a form that was defined directly in the Form Component's configuration in this 
page's Front Matter. There is no difference between creating a form anonymously, like this one, and creating one like 
normal as a form file, except that it is easier to share a form file throughout your site. However, anonymous forms are
great for forms that are more complex and only are used on a single page.
